# csci-1470-final-project
This is the readme for our final project

All of our good code can be found in the model code INCLUDING THE PREPROCESSING AND THE MAIN FUNCTION.
We couldn't delete some of our old files so the preprocessing.py and main.py found outside of the 
model folder are old files that we no longer want/need. The folder old preprocessing.py has several of
our previous attempts at preprocessing before we got it right. This took most of our time on this
assignment which is one of the reasons we had to use a backup model instead of our previous plan to 
use a transformer.

Our original model can be found in the transformer folder. Unfortunately we could not get this to run
due to errors and a lack of time. Instead we built a backup model which can be found in the backup_model 
folder. This model can be run using backup_main.py inside the model folder and the results of which are
stored in the outputlog/10000 folder. NOTE: THIS IS THE ONLY FOLDER OUTSIDE OF MODEL THAT HAS IMPORTANT THINGS.

If the backup_main.py inside of the model folder is run when cd'd into the model folder there should be no errors
and you should be able to reproduce the results.

If we had more time we would have gotten our original transformer model to work but unfortunately we ran out.
